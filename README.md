The code contained produces a graphical representation of daily new cases of COVID-19, filterable by region of the UK, alongside a graph detailing daily cumulative COVID-19 deaths. 

On initialisation the graph will contain old, 'canned' data which can be refreshed, calling data from Public Health England.
